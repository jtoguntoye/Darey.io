# Ansible configuration management

## Task: 
- Install and configure Ansible client to act as a Bastion host/Jump server
- Create a simple Ansible playbook to automate server configuration
         

## Install and configure Ansible on EC2 instance
- The same EC2 instance used for jenkins in project 9 will be used as Ansible server in this project.
- Create Github repository named `ansble-config-mgt`
- Install Ansible
```
sudo apt update

sudo apt install ansible
```
-Ansible version installed :

- Configure Jenkins build job to save the `ansible-config-mgt` repository content every time the repo changes
   - Create a freestyle project in Jenkins
   - configure github webhook and set the webhook to trigger a build in Jenkins

     - configure a post-build action to save all `**`  files i.e archive the build
     - Test setup by making changes to the readMe file in the `ansible-config-mgt` repo and commit the changes. This will trigger a build and archive the build files in the     default location  ```/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/```

- The architecture after setting up jenkins and Ansible on a bastion server is shown below:

-Assign an Elastic Ip to the Jenkins server to avoid having to reconfigure github webhook everytime you restart the Jenkins server.

## Prepare  using VS Code and begin Ansible development
 - setup VSCode to connect to github repo
 - Create a new branch to be used to create new features named ```feature/prj11```
 - Checkout the ```feature/prj11``` branch and create new directories ```inventory``` and ```playbooks``` to be used to store the inventory and playbook files respectively
 - Create a new file named ```common.yml``` in the playbook directory.
 - In the inventory directory create new files `dev.yml`, `staging.yml`, `uat.yml` and `prod.yml` for different environments (development, staging, testing and production environments)
 
 ## setup Ansible inventory
 - The infastructure for the development environment is added to the `inventory/dev.yml` file.

 -  To allow ansible SSH into the target servers. Copy the Private key file for the servers to the Ansible server and ensure the permissions on the file is set to `chmod 400 key.pem` . Also import the key into `ssh-agent`
 ```
 eval `ssh-agent -s`
 ssh-add <path-to-private-key>
 ```
## Create a common playbook
- Update the `playbooks/common.yml` file with the following code which installs wireshark utility on the web, nfs, db and lb servers
```
---
- name: update web, nfs and db servers
  hosts: webservers, nfs, db
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
    yum:
      name: wireshark
      state: latest

- name: update LB server
  hosts: lb
  remote_user: ubuntu
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
    apt:
      name: wireshark
      state: latest
```

## Update Git with the latest code
- Commit the changes to the feature brancha and create a pull request (PR) for the branch to be merged into the master branch

- Once mergeed into master branch,
