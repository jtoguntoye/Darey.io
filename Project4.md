## Step 3- Installing Express Js and setting up routes to the server
- Next, Installed Express Js and mongoose (for setting up db schema) with the command:
```
sudo npm install express mongoose
```
- Next, created the ```apps``` directory and added the ```routes.js``` file in it.
- Also in the ```apps``` directory, created the ```models``` directory and added the ```books.js``` file with it contents

## Step 4 -Accessing the routes with AngularJs
- Created a ```public``` directory in the ```Books``` directory  and added a file named ```script.js``` in it 
- Also added the ```index.html``` file to the ```public``` directory with the required file content
