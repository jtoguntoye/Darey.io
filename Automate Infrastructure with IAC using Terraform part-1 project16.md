## Prerequisite
- Create a user in your AWS account named `terraform` that has only programmatic access to AWS (i.e user has only secret access key and no password) and grant the user AdministratorAccess permission

User created using the admin user with access key created for the user:

- Configure programmatic access for the created `terraform` user using AWS CLI with `aws configure` command. Also install `boto3` python SDK on your machine. At its core all `Boto3` does is call AWS APIs on your behalf

- Create an S3 bucket to store Terraform state files. You can name the bucket `<yourname>-dev-terraform-bucket`. S3 bucket names must be unique globally within an AWS region.
 - You can create S3 buckets from AWS CLI using the command:
  ```
  aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-bucket --region us-east-1
  ```

- To confirm the S3 bucket created use Boto3 SDK

## General steps to using Terraform
- Scope: Identify the infrastructure for your project
- Author: Write the configuration to define your infrastructure
- Initialize: Install the required Terraform Providers
- Plan: Preview the changes Terraform will make
- Apply: Apply the changes Terraform will make
